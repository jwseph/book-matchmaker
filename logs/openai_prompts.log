Your task is to provide a BRIEF (1-2 tight sentences, ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM 40 words per reasoning) and UNIQUE justification for EACH book listed above.
The primary goal is to make each reasoning distinct and compelling, helping the student differentiate effectively between these recommendations.
Focus on CONCRETE details, evocative questions, or intriguing specific aspects of each book. Avoid vague adjectives or generic themes that could apply to many books.
Make the reasoning specific to *this student's* survey responses. Hook the reader with tone and specificity.

For each book, sell it to the student. Focus on specific, concrete nuggets from the book that align directly with their stated preferences or previous positive experiences mentioned in their survey responses. Frame each reasoning as "Why you'll love this book: [reasoning]".

IMPORTANT STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Each reasoning MUST be unique to its book and distinct from others in this batch.
- Start each reasoning *directly* with the suggested framing phrase (e.g., "Why you'll love this book: ...").
- Do NOT reiterate the book's title or author in the reasoning itself.
- Be succinct and impactful. Sacrifice generality for specificity.
- Ensure your reasoning for one book doesn't sound like it could apply to another book in the list.
- You are trying to hook a Honors English 9th grader into reading a book!
- Use rhetorical devices without restraint: rhetorical questions, parallelisms, anastrophe, etc.

Your task is to provide a BRIEF (1-2 tight sentences, ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM 40 words per reasoning) and UNIQUE justification for EACH book listed above.
The primary goal is to make each reasoning distinct and compelling, helping the student differentiate effectively between these recommendations.
Focus on CONCRETE details, evocative questions, or intriguing specific aspects of each book. Avoid vague adjectives or generic themes that could apply to many books.
Make the reasoning specific to *this student's* survey responses. Hook the reader with tone and specificity.

For each book, sell it to the student. Focus on specific, concrete nuggets from the book that align directly with their stated preferences or previous positive experiences mentioned in their survey responses. Frame each reasoning as "Why you'll love this book: [reasoning]".

IMPORTANT STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Each reasoning MUST be unique to its book and distinct from others in this batch.
- Start each reasoning *directly* with the suggested framing phrase (e.g., "Why you'll love this book: ...").
- Do NOT reiterate the book's title or author in the reasoning itself.
- Be succinct and impactful. Sacrifice generality for specificity.
- Ensure your reasoning for one book doesn't sound like it could apply to another book in the list.

- Be bold! in "differentTaste" recommendations.
- Any book from the list is fine! As long as it's a good fit. Feel free to recommend niche, not-as-popular books.
- Aim for a chunk of books to be less known.

You MUST respond with a JSON object. The JSON object must have exactly two top-level keys: "likelyToEnjoy" and "differentTaste".
Each of these keys must correspond to an array of book recommendation objects.
Each book recommendation object in these arrays MUST have ONLY the following key:
1.  "bookString": string - The exact "TITLE by AUTHOR" string of the book selected from the provided "AVAILABLE BOOKS" list.

Do NOT include a "reasoning" key in this response.
Provide up to 10 books for "likelyToEnjoy", ranked in order of most likely enjoyment.
Provide up to 10 books for "differentTaste", also ranked.
Do not include any books in your response that are not in the "AVAILABLE BOOKS" list.
Ensure the "bookString" field in your response exactly matches one of the entries in the "AVAILABLE BOOKS" list.

Your task is to provide a BRIEF (1-2 tight sentences, ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM 40 words per reasoning) and UNIQUE justification for EACH book listed above.
The primary goal is to make each reasoning distinct and compelling, helping the student differentiate effectively between these recommendations.
Focus on CONCRETE details, evocative questions, or intriguing specific aspects of each book. Avoid vague adjectives or generic themes that could apply to many books.
Make the reasoning specific to *this student's* survey responses. Hook the reader with tone and specificity.

For each book, sell it to the student. Focus on specific, concrete nuggets from the book that align directly with their stated preferences or previous positive experiences mentioned in their survey responses. Frame each reasoning as "Why you'll love this book: [reasoning]".

IMPORTANT STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Each reasoning MUST be unique to its book and distinct from others in this batch.
- Start each reasoning *directly* with the suggested framing phrase (e.g., "Why you'll love this book: ...").
- Do NOT reiterate the book's title or author in the reasoning itself.
- Be succinct and impactful. Sacrifice generality for specificity.
- Ensure your reasoning for one book doesn't sound like it could apply to another book in the list.
- You are trying to hook a Honors English 9th grader into reading a book!
- Use rhetorical devices without restraint: rhetorical questions, parallelisms, anastrophe, etc.
- Have fun! The tone of a friend who is excited to recommend a book.
- What specific preferences in the student's responses led to this recommendation? As a student I want to know why you recommended this book!
- Remember: Listen closely to FRQ answers. They mean more to students than MCQ responses.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
You MUST respond with a single JSON object. This object should map each exact "TITLE by AUTHOR" string (from the input book list) to its unique, concrete reasoning string.
Example JSON structure:
{
  "Book One Title by Author A": "Why you'll love this book: [Unique, concrete, and evocative reasoning for Book One, max 40 words, connecting to student preferences if 'likelyToEnjoy', or highlighting surprising elements if 'differentTaste']",
  "Book Two Title by Author B": "Why you'll love this book: [Unique, concrete, and evocative reasoning for Book Two...]"
  // ... and so on for all books provided
}
Ensure the keys in the JSON object exactly match the "TITLE by AUTHOR" strings of the books.
Your entire response must be only this JSON object.

The primary goal is to make each reasoning distinct and compelling, helping the student differentiate effectively between these recommendations.
Focus on CONCRETE details, evocative questions, or intriguing specific aspects of each book. Avoid vague adjectives or generic themes that could apply to many books.
Make the reasoning specific to *this student's* survey responses. Hook the reader with tone and specificity.

For each book, highlight specific, concrete aspects that could offer a surprising new perspective, a unique learning opportunity, or an unexpected appeal that might challenge their current tastes positively. Frame each reasoning as "Why this book might surprise you: [reasoning]" or "Why you'll like this book more than you think: [reasoning]".

IMPORTANT STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Each reasoning MUST be unique to its book and distinct from others in this batch.

You are recommending a set of books for this student under the category: "Books You'll Likely Enjoy".

Your first task is to generate an engaging overall statement for this category, using the following template and adapting it to the student's responses:
"Woohoo! Based on your awesome quiz answers, it looks like you're a fan of [ADAPTIVE SUMMARY BASED ON QUIZ - e.g., dystopian thrillers with a side of intellectual challenge and just a pinch of darkness]. Get ready to dive into these picks!"

Next, for each book in the list below, your task is to provide a BRIEF (1-2 tight sentences, ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM 40 words per reasoning) and UNIQUE justification.
The student already has access to the full title, author, and general summary for each book. DO NOT repeat these elements in your reasoning.

Here are the books in this set:
- "Crime and Punishment" by Fyodor Dostoevsky (Key info: A young, impoverished former student in Saint Petersburg, Russia, formulates a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker to redistribute her wealth among the needy. However, after carrying out the act, he is consumed by guilt...)\\n- "The Trial" by Franz Kafka (Key info: The book revolves around a bank clerk who wakes one morning to find himself under arrest for an unspecified crime. Despite not being detained, he is subjected to the psychological torment of a bizarre and...)\\n- "Nineteen Eighty Four" by George Orwell (Key info: Set in a dystopian future, the novel presents a society under the total control of a totalitarian regime, led by the omnipresent Big Brother.

The society is divided into five castes, each with its...)\\n- "Steppenwolf" by Hermann Hesse (Key info: The novel presents a poignant exploration of a man's struggle with his dual nature. The protagonist, a middle-aged man, finds himself torn between his humanistic, intellectual tendencies and his more primitive, wolf-like instincts. As he...)\\n- "Heart of Darkness" by Joseph Conrad (Key info: This classic novel follows the journey of a seaman who travels up the Congo River into the African interior to meet a mysterious ivory trader.

The primary goal for individual book reasonings is to make each distinct and compelling, helping the student differentiate effectively.
Focus on CONCRETE details, evocative questions, or intriguing specific aspects of each book. Avoid vague adjectives or generic themes.
Make the reasoning specific to *this student's* survey responses. Hook the reader with tone and specificity.

For each book, sell it to the student. Focus on specific, concrete nuggets from the book that align directly with their stated preferences or previous positive experiences mentioned in their survey responses. Frame each reasoning as "Why you'll love this book: [reasoning]".

IMPORTANT STYLE GUIDELINES (for individual book reasonings):
- Each reasoning MUST be unique to its book and distinct from others in this batch.
- Start each reasoning *directly* with the suggested framing phrase (e.g., "Why you'll love this book: ...").
- Do NOT reiterate the book's title or author in the reasoning itself.
- Be succinct and impactful. Sacrifice generality for specificity.
- Ensure your reasoning for one book doesn't sound like it could apply to another book in the list.
- You are trying to hook a Honors English 9th grader into reading a book!
- Use rhetorical devices without restraint: rhetorical questions, parallelisms, anastrophe, etc.
- Have fun! The tone of a friend who is excited to recommend a book.
- What specific preferences in the student's responses led to this recommendation? As a student I want to know why you recommended this book!
- Remember: Listen closely to FRQ answers. They mean more to students than MCQ responses.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
You MUST respond with a single JSON object. This object must have exactly two top-level keys:
1. "overallStatement": string - This should be the engaging overall statement you generated first, adapted from the template and student responses.
2. "bookReasonings": object - This object should map each exact "TITLE by AUTHOR" string (from the input book list) to its unique, concrete reasoning string (max 40 words, following style guidelines).

Example JSON structure:
{
  "overallStatement": "Based on your love for [specific theme] and [another preference], here are some books you might find captivating!",
  "bookReasonings": {
    "Book One Title by Author A": "Why you'll love this book: [Unique, concrete, and evocative reasoning for Book One...]",
    "Book Two Title by Author B": "Why you'll love this book: [Unique, concrete, and evocative reasoning for Book Two...]"
  }
}
Ensure the keys in the "bookReasonings" object exactly match the "TITLE by AUTHOR" strings of the books.
Your entire response must be only this JSON object.

You are recommending a set of books for this student under the category: "Books You'll Likely Enjoy".

Your first task is to generate an engaging overall statement for this category, using the following template and adapting it to the student's responses:
"Woohoo! Based on your awesome quiz answers, it looks like you're a fan of [ADAPTIVE SUMMARY BASED ON QUIZ - e.g., dystopian thrillers with a side of intellectual challenge and just a pinch of darkness]. Get ready to dive into these picks!"

Next, for each book in the list below, your task is to provide a BRIEF (1-2 tight sentences, ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM 40 words per reasoning) and UNIQUE justification.
The student already has access to the full title, author, and general summary for each book. DO NOT repeat these elements in your reasoning.

Here are the books in this set:
- "The Hobbit" by J. R. R. Tolkien (Key info: In this fantasy novel, a timid and unadventurous hobbit named Bilbo Baggins is whisked away on a grand adventure by a wizard and a group of dwarves.

The primary goal for individual book reasonings is to make each distinct and compelling, helping the student differentiate effectively.
Focus on CONCRETE details, evocative questions, or intriguing specific aspects of each book. Avoid vague adjectives or generic themes.
Make the reasoning specific to *this student's* survey responses. Hook the reader with tone and specificity.

For each book, sell it to the student. Focus on specific, concrete nuggets from the book that align directly with their stated preferences or previous positive experiences mentioned in their survey responses. Frame each reasoning as "Why you'll love this book: [reasoning]".

IMPORTANT STYLE GUIDELINES (for individual book reasonings):
- Each reasoning MUST be unique to its book and distinct from others in this batch.
- Start each reasoning *directly* with the suggested framing phrase (e.g., "Why you'll love this book: ...").
- Do NOT reiterate the book's title or author in the reasoning itself.
- Be succinct and impactful. Sacrifice generality for specificity.
- Ensure your reasoning for one book doesn't sound like it could apply to another book in the list.

You are recommending a set of books for this student under the category: "Books You'll Likely Enjoy".
Your tone should be that of an insightful and engaging literary companion: knowledgeable, friendly, and subtly enthusiastic.

Your first task is to distill the student's preferences into a concise and fitting literary profile or genre label (e.g., "Intrepid Explorer of Historical Epics," "Connoisseur of Modernist Fiction," "Seeker of Philosophical Mysteries").

Your second task is to generate an engaging overall narrative for this category. This narrative should incorporate the literary profile label you just created.
It should start with "Your literary profile suggests: [Generated Literary Profile/Genre Label]."
Then, on a new line, continue with a paragraph that thoughtfully summarizes why this collection of books is being presented, using the following template and adapting it intelligently to the student's specific responses:
"Based on your survey responses, your preferences appear to align with [ADAPTIVE SUMMARY OF PREFERENCES - e.g., intellectually stimulating narratives, perhaps with a focus on character-driven stories or specific thematic elements]. The following selections have been chosen with these aspects in mind."

Next, for each book in the list below, your task is to provide a BRIEF (1-2 tight sentences, ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM 40 words per reasoning) and UNIQUE justification.

Focus on CONCRETE details, evocative questions, or intriguing specific aspects of each book. Avoid vague adjectives or generic themes.
Make the reasoning specific to *this student's* survey responses. Hook the reader with tone and specificity.

For each book, highlight specific, concrete aspects that could offer a surprising new perspective, a unique learning opportunity, or an unexpected appeal that might challenge their current tastes positively. Frame each reasoning as "Why this book might surprise you: [reasoning]" or "Why you'll like this book more than you think: [reasoning]".

IMPORTANT STYLE GUIDELINES (for individual book reasonings):
- Each reasoning MUST be unique to its book and distinct from others in this batch.
- Start each reasoning *directly* with the suggested framing phrase (e.g., "Why this book might surprise you: ...").
- Do NOT reiterate the book's title or author in the reasoning itself.
- Be succinct and impactful. Sacrifice generality for specificity.
- Ensure your reasoning for one book doesn't sound like it could apply to another book in the list.
- Aim to be an insightful guide for a 9th-grade Honors English student.
- Use rhetorical devices thoughtfully: rhetorical questions, parallelisms, anastrophe, etc.
- Maintain an engaging, knowledgeable, and subtly enthusiastic tone.
- What specific preferences in the student's responses led to this recommendation? As a student I want to know why you recommended this book!
- Remember: Listen closely to FRQ answers. They mean more to students than MCQ responses.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
You MUST respond with a single JSON object. This object must have exactly two top-level keys:
1. "overallStatement": string - This string must begin with "Your literary profile suggests: [Generated Literary Profile/Genre Label].", followed by a newline character (\\n), and then the longer narrative paragraph you generated.
2. "bookReasonings": object - This object should map each exact "TITLE by AUTHOR" string (from the input book list) to its unique, concrete reasoning string (max 40 words, following style guidelines).

Example JSON structure:
{
  "overallStatement": "Your literary profile suggests: Connoisseur of Classic Mysteries.\\nBased on your enjoyment of intricate plots and historical settings, these classic detective novels offer a wealth of suspense and clever deduction for you to explore.",
  "bookReasonings": {
    "Book One Title by Author A": "Why this book might surprise you: [Unique, concrete, and evocative reasoning for Book One...]",
    "Book Two Title by Author B": "Why this book might surprise you: [Unique, concrete, and evocative reasoning for Book Two...]"
  }
}
Ensure the keys in the "bookReasonings" object exactly match the "TITLE by AUTHOR" strings of the books.
Your entire response must be only this JSON object.

You are recommending a set of books for this student under the category: "Books to Expand Your Taste".
Your tone should be that of an insightful and engaging literary companion: knowledgeable, friendly, and subtly enthusiastic.

Your first task is to distill the student's preferences into a concise and fitting literary profile or genre label (e.g., "Intrepid Explorer of Historical Epics," "Connoisseur of Modernist Fiction," "Seeker of Philosophical Mysteries").

Your second task is to generate an engaging overall narrative for this category. This narrative should incorporate the literary profile label you just created.
It should start with "Your literary profile suggests: [Generated Literary Profile/Genre Label]."
Then, on a new line, continue with a paragraph that thoughtfully summarizes why this collection of books is being presented, using the following template and adapting it intelligently to the student's specific responses:
"To help broaden your literary horizons, these selections, while resonating with some of your stated preferences such as [ADAPTIVE SUMMARY - e.g., engaging plots or familiar genres], also introduce new elements like [ADAPTIVE EXAMPLES - e.g., different narrative styles, thematic explorations, or genres] that you might find unexpectedly compelling."

Next, for each book in the list below, your task is to provide a BRIEF (1-2 tight sentences, ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM 40 words per reasoning) and UNIQUE justification.
The student already has access to the full title, author, and general summary for each book. DO NOT repeat these elements in your reasoning.

Here are the books in this set:
- "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle" by Haruki Murakami (Key info: A man's search for his wife's missing cat evolves into a surreal journey through Tokyo's underbelly, where he encounters a bizarre collection of characters with strange stories and peculiar obsessions. As he delves deeper, he...)\\n- "The Master and Margarita" by Mikhail Bulgakov (Key info: This novel is a complex narrative that weaves together three distinct yet intertwined stories.

Together,...)\\n- "Slaughterhouse-Five" by Kurt Vonnegut (Key info: The novel follows the life of Billy Pilgrim, a World War II veteran who has become "unstuck in time," experiencing his life events out of order.

The story follows a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier stationed in Italy, who is...)

The primary goal for individual book reasonings is to make each distinct and compelling, helping the student differentiate effectively.
Focus on CONCRETE details, evocative questions, or intriguing specific aspects of each book. Avoid vague adjectives or generic themes.
Make the reasoning specific to *this student's* survey responses. Hook the reader with tone and specificity.

For each book, highlight specific, concrete aspects that could offer a surprising new perspective, a unique learning opportunity, or an unexpected appeal that might challenge their current tastes positively. Frame each reasoning as "Why this book might surprise you: [reasoning]" or "Why you'll like this book more than you think: [reasoning]".

IMPORTANT STYLE GUIDELINES (for individual book reasonings):
- Each reasoning MUST be unique to its book and distinct from others in this batch.
- Start each reasoning *directly* with the suggested framing phrase (e.g., "Why this book might surprise you: ...").
- Do NOT reiterate the book's title or author in the reasoning itself.
- Be succinct and impactful. Sacrifice generality for specificity.
- Ensure your reasoning for one book doesn't sound like it could apply to another book in the list.
- Aim to be an insightful guide for a 9th-grade Honors English student.
- Use rhetorical devices thoughtfully: rhetorical questions, parallelisms, anastrophe, etc.
- Maintain an engaging, knowledgeable, and subtly enthusiastic tone.
- What specific preferences in the student's responses led to this recommendation? As a student I want to know why you recommended this book!
- Remember: Listen closely to FRQ answers. They mean more to students than MCQ responses.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
You MUST respond with a single JSON object. This object must have exactly two top-level keys:
1. "overallStatement": string - This string must begin with "Your literary profile suggests: [Generated Literary Profile/Genre Label].", followed by a newline character (\\n), and then the longer narrative paragraph you generated.
2. "bookReasonings": object - This object should map each exact "TITLE by AUTHOR" string (from the input book list) to its unique, concrete reasoning string (max 40 words, following style guidelines).

Example JSON structure:
{
  "overallStatement": "Your literary profile suggests: Connoisseur of Classic Mysteries.\\nBased on your enjoyment of intricate plots and historical settings, these classic detective novels offer a wealth of suspense and clever deduction for you to explore.",
  "bookReasonings": {
    "Book One Title by Author A": "Why this book might surprise you: [Unique, concrete, and evocative reasoning for Book One...]",
    "Book Two Title by Author B": "Why this book might surprise you: [Unique, concrete, and evocative reasoning for Book Two...]"
  }
}
Ensure the keys in the "bookReasonings" object exactly match the "TITLE by AUTHOR" strings of the books.
Your entire response must be only this JSON object.

You are recommending a set of books for this student under the category: "Books You'll Likely Enjoy".

Your first task is to distill the student's preferences into a concise and fitting literary profile or genre label (e.g., "Intrepid Explorer of Historical Epics," "Connoisseur of Modernist Fiction," "Seeker of Philosophical Mysteries").

Your second task is to generate an engaging overall narrative for this category. This narrative should incorporate the literary profile label you just created.
It should start with "Your literary profile suggests: [Generated Literary Profile/Genre Label]."
Then, on a new line, continue with a paragraph that thoughtfully summarizes why this collection of books is being presented, using the following template and adapting it intelligently to the student's specific responses:
"Based on your survey responses, your preferences appear to align with [ADAPTIVE SUMMARY OF PREFERENCES - e.g., intellectually stimulating narratives, perhaps with a focus on character-driven stories or specific thematic elements]. The following selections have been chosen with these aspects in mind."

Next, for each book in the list below, your task is to provide a BRIEF (1-2 tight sentences, ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM 40 words per reasoning) and UNIQUE justification.

The primary goal for individual book reasonings is to make each distinct and compelling, helping the student differentiate effectively.
Focus on CONCRETE details, evocative questions, or intriguing specific aspects of each book. Avoid vague adjectives or generic themes.
Make the reasoning specific to *this student's* survey responses. Hook the reader with tone and specificity.

For each book, sell it to the student. Focus on specific, concrete nuggets from the book that align directly with their stated preferences or previous positive experiences mentioned in their survey responses. Frame each reasoning as "Why you'll love this book: [reasoning]".

IMPORTANT STYLE GUIDELINES (for individual book reasonings):
- Each reasoning MUST be unique to its book and distinct from others in this batch.
- Start each reasoning *directly* with the suggested framing phrase (e.g., "Why you'll love this book: ...").
- Do NOT reiterate the book's title or author in the reasoning itself.
- Be succinct and impactful. Sacrifice generality for specificity.
- Ensure your reasoning for one book doesn't sound like it could apply to another book in the list.
- Aim to be an insightful guide for a 9th-grade Honors English student.
- Use rhetorical devices thoughtfully: rhetorical questions, parallelisms, anastrophe, etc.
- Maintain an engaging, knowledgeable, and subtly enthusiastic tone.
- What specific preferences in the student's responses led to this recommendation? As a student I want to know why you recommended this book!
- Remember: Listen closely to FRQ answers. They mean more to students than MCQ responses.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
You MUST respond with a single JSON object. This object must have exactly two top-level keys:
1. "overallStatement": string - This string must begin with "Your literary profile suggests: [Generated Literary Profile/Genre Label].", followed by a newline character (\\n), and then the longer narrative paragraph you generated.

The primary goal for individual book reasonings is to make each distinct and compelling, helping the student differentiate effectively.
Focus on CONCRETE details, evocative questions, or intriguing specific aspects of each book. Avoid vague adjectives or generic themes.
Make the reasoning specific to *this student's* survey responses. Hook the reader with tone and specificity.

For each book, highlight specific, concrete aspects that could offer a surprising new perspective, a unique learning opportunity, or an unexpected appeal that might challenge their current tastes positively. Frame each reasoning as "Why this book might surprise you: [reasoning]" or "Why you'll like this book more than you think: [reasoning]".

IMPORTANT STYLE GUIDELINES (for individual book reasonings):
- Each reasoning MUST be unique to its book and distinct from others in this batch.
- Start each reasoning *directly* with the suggested framing phrase (e.g., "Why this book might surprise you: ...").
- Do NOT reiterate the book's title or author in the reasoning itself.
- Be succinct and impactful. Sacrifice generality for specificity.
- Ensure your reasoning for one book doesn't sound like it could apply to another book in the list.
- Aim to be an insightful guide for a 9th-grade Honors English student.
- Use rhetorical devices thoughtfully: rhetorical questions, parallelisms, anastrophe, etc.
- Maintain an engaging, knowledgeable, and subtly enthusiastic tone.
- What specific preferences in the student's responses led to this recommendation? As a student I want to know why you recommended this book!
- Remember: Listen closely to FRQ answers. They mean more to students than MCQ responses.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
You MUST respond with a single JSON object. This object must have exactly two top-level keys:
1. "overallStatement": string - This string must begin with "Your literary profile suggests: [Generated Literary Profile/Genre Label].", followed by a newline character (\\n), and then the longer narrative paragraph you generated.
2. "bookReasonings": object - This object should map each exact "TITLE by AUTHOR" string (from the input book list) to its unique, concrete reasoning string (max 40 words, following style guidelines).
